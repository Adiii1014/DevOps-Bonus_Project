TDD - Test Driven Development

This is a Test Driven Calculator. 
There are 3 following files

Before you begin, do -> npm install
After -> npm mocha -g


1. To show the output of test cases, you need to type in the commandPrompt 'mocha testCases.js' and it would show all the test cases passing.
2. When you want to start the program to calculate you need to go back to root folder and write 'node calc.js' in the commandPrompt to start the calculator 

Main purpose was to create test cases.
